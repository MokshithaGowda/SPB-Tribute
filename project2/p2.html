        <p><q>Panditaradhyula Balasubrahmanyam (4 June 1946) – (25 September 2020)</q> also referred to as S. P. B was an Indian musician, playback
          singer, music director, actor, dubbing artist, and film producer who worked predominantly in Telugu, Tamil,
          Kannada, Hindi, and Malayalam films. Widely regarded as one of the greatest singers of India, He won six
          National Film Awards for Best Male Playback Singer for his works in four different languages; Telugu, Tamil,
          Kannada, and Hindi. According to some sources, he held the Guinness World Record for recording the highest
          number of songs by a singer with over 40,000 songs. He recorded 21 songs in Kannada for the composer Upendra
          Kumar in Bengaluru from 9 am to 9 pm on 8 February 1981. In addition, he recorded 19 songs in Tamil and 16
          songs in Hindi in a day, which has also been called a record.</p>
        <p>Even when he talks, he seems to sing. In whatever language you’ve heard him, and whatever kind of song you
          love him for, there’s no way you wouldn’t have heard an S.P. Balasubrahmanyam song if you’re an Indian,
          because he’s sung more than 40,000!.Despite a fabulous musical career spanning 49 years in the Telugu, Tamil,
          Kannada, Hindi, and Malayalam film industries, SPB remains down to earth.</p>
        <p>Balasubrahmanyam made his debut as a playback singer on 15 December 1966 with Sri Sri Sri Maryada Ramanna, 
          a Telugu film scored by his mentor, S. P. Kodandapani. The first non-Telugu song that he recorded 
          just eight days after his debut Telugu song was in Kannada in 1966 for the film Nakkare Ade Swarga,
          starring Kannada comedy stalwart T. R. Narasimharaju. He recorded his first Tamil song 
          "Athaanodu Ippadi Irundhu Eththanai Naalaachu", a duet with L. R. Eswari under the musical direction of
          M. S. Viswanathan for the film Hotel Ramba, which was never released. Other early songs he sang were duets with 
          P. Susheela, "Iyarkai Ennum Ilaya Kanni" in the 1969 film Shanti Nilayam, starring Gemini Ganesh, and
         <q>Aayiram Nilavae Vaa</q> for M. G. Ramachandran in Adimaippenn.His first song with S. Janaki was <q>Pournami Nilavil Pani Vizhum Iravil</q>
         in Kannippenn. He was then introduced to the Malayalam film industry by G. Devarajan in the film Kadalppalam.</p>
        <p>Balasubrahmanyam came to international prominence with the 1980 film Sankarabharanam. The film is considered to be one
          of the best films ever to emerge from the Telugu film industry.Directed by K. Vishwanath, the film's soundtrack was composed
          by K.V. Mahadevan, and led to an increase in the usage of Carnatic music in Telugu cinema. Not a classically trained singer, 
          he used a "film music" aesthetic in recording the songs. Balasubrahmanyam received his first National Film Award for 
          Best Male Playback Singer for his work. His first work in Hindi films was in the following year, in Ek Duuje Ke Liye (1981),
          composed by Laxmikant Pyarelal for which he received another National Film Award for Best Male Playback Singer.
          Balasubrahmanyam began to record more songs in Telugu and other South Indian languages, especially for Ilaiyaraaja with S.
          Janaki, the trio considered to be highly successful in the Telugu film industry from the late 1970s and throughout the 1980s.
          The songs were based on classical music, such as in Saagara Sangamam (1983) and Rudraveena (1988), for which both Ilaiyaraaja
          and Balasubrahmanyam won National Awards for Best Music Director and Best Male Playback Singer respectively.
          In 1989, Balasubrahmanyam was the playback singer for actor Salman Khan in the blockbuster Maine Pyar Kiya. The soundtrack for 
          the film was very successful and he won a Filmfare Award for Best Male Playback Singer for the song Dil Deewana. For much of the next decade,
          Balasubrahmanyam continued as the "romantic singing voice" on the soundtracks of Khan's films. Notable among these was Hum Aapke Hain Koun..!
          which became the highest-grossing Hindi film of all time.Balasubrahmanyam's duet with Lata Mangeshkar, "Didi Tera Devar Deewana", was very popular. 
          This solidified Balasubrahmanyam as one of the biggest playback singers in India. SP Balasubrahmanyam became identified as Salman Khan's
          voice in the 90s just like Kishore Kumar became Rajesh Khanna’s voice through the 70s.</p>
